## How to write a log likelihood function

* What key elements are required in a log likelihood function to be used in the sampler
* Show comparison times for slow LL and fast LL
* Check list for commmon errors - brief list check this, check that etc.



### Wiley's commonestststs Rog-Rikri-hood errors

<b>1. Changing parameter values changes the log likelihood value</b>
* Preliminary step to check log likelihood function - If you update your parameter values, your log likelihood SHOULD also change.
• Then check if changing parameter values which rely on conditions actually change the log likelihood



• The parameter specified (for example x[‘b’]) does not exist, is not specified to be estimated (in the parameter names arg) or is misspelled
 - Same as mentioned earlier. Make sure params vector is of the same length and same names, becuase the log likelihood function will not throw and error.

• A column in if and for loops is not a factor (i.e. `data$condition` is a character vector -> this will break things like if (`data$condition == “easy”`) and `x[‘b1’,’b2’][data$condition]`

Needs to be factor

else 


• Columns are misspelled or do not exist i.e. data$RT is actually data$rt
• When making a vector of parameter values - values are not filling in properly (ie you may be making a vector for b for all the values across the data set to be used, but there are NAs filling it somewhere)
• Vector of parameters should be the log. The first line should be exp(x). Make sure operations are done on the right scale
• The response/rt vector is in the wrong scale (logged, seconds rather than milliseconds etc)
• The log likelihood is not printed/outputted at the end - sum the logs of the likelihood at or before the end
• When sampling, the generated columns are not outputted
• If doing trial-wise functions - i must be specified throughout - ie can’t just be if (data$condition == “easy”) - needs to be (data$condition[i] == “easy”) throughout
