# Introduction to Particle Based Sampler for MCMC

Contains implementations of particle based sampling methods for model parameter estimation. Primarily an implementation of the Particle Metropolis within Gibbs sampler outlined in the paper available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10089, it also contains code for covariance estimation and time varying models.

## Assumed knowledge
- Modelling knowledge
- Familiarity with particular packages? E.g. rtdists


## Computational Requirements
* R Version
* Packages
* Memory
* Document computational requirements - memory 200mb
* Minutes
* Size of samples
* Memory required
* Can it be done on a grid or laptop

## Background information

* What is particle metropolis
* What is Gibbs?
* Why a multivariate normal?
* The prior is 'fixed'
