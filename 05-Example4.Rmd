# First (simple) example - Signal Detection Feary

This first example should/could demostrate how to use the sampler in a simple/widely understood context e.g. signal detection theory.  We can show analytic solutions alongside the samplers estimates to show that it works.

A second example might cover another SDT example with the addition of trial level covariate i.e. analytic solution NA.
